#Telegram Uploader Bot

This project implements a Telegram bot built using the Pyrogram library. Its primary function is to facilitate file sharing within Telegram chats by generating links that users can share directly.

Features:

File Linking: Uploads files received from users to a chosen storage provider (e.g., cloud storage platform) and generates a shareable link.
Accessibility: Simplifies file sharing for users who prefer links over in-chat media.

Configuration:

1. Bot Token:

Obtain your Telegram bot token from BotFather (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UQrcOj63S2o).

Store the token securely in a .env file at the project root:

BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
2. Storage Provider (Optional):

If you prefer using an external storage provider for file uploads (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox), configure the necessary settings in a separate configuration file (e.g., config.py).
Refer to the documentation of your chosen storage provider's API for specific configuration instructions.
3. Link Expiration (Optional):

If you want links to expire after a certain period of inactivity, define a default expiration time (in seconds) within the bot code. This can be adjusted based on your requirements.
Running the Bot:

python bot.py

2. Invite the Bot to Your Telegram Group or Chat:

Open Telegram and search for your bot using its username.
Add the bot to your desired Telegram group or chat.
Using the Bot:

Send files directly to the bot in your Telegram chat.
The bot will upload the file to the chosen storage provider and generate a shareable link.
Share the generated link with anyone who needs to access the file.
Additional Notes:

Depending on your chosen storage provider, you might need to install additional libraries to handle file uploads and link generation.
Consider implementing error handling and logging for a more robust experience.
Explore advanced features like file size limitations, user authentication, or custom link prefixes (if applicable to your storage provider).
Disclaimer:

This is a basic template to get you started. You may need to modify the code and configuration based on your specific requirements and chosen storage provider.
